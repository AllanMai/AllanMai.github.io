    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a first generation college student. In fact, my family hasn't had a college graduate
      for over three generations on either side. I am a father and husband as well. I am majoring in
      economics and geography at the same time. I enjoy learning and have since I was a small child.
      I love economics/econometrics and am fascinated by geospatial relationships. </p>

    <h2> My priorities</h2>
    <h4><strong>Goals:</strong></h4>
    <p><strong>1:</strong> Accomplish Dual Degree's in Economics and Geography - with a minor in Statistics</p>
    <p><strong>2:</strong> Get accepted to an Economics PhD program</p>
    <p><strong>3:</strong> Complete PhD program and enter workforce.</p>

  <div class="container-fluid text-center bg-1">
    <h4><strong>My Vision:</strong></h4>
    <p>I will study one of my interests in a PhD Program. My main interest is studying and figuring out the
      connections between econometrics/microeconomics and spatial statistics/analysis. Along with this, I am
      interested in environmental/natural resource/water economics, business applications of spatial economics,
      public economics. I will further integrate econometrics and spatial statistics in one of these areas.
